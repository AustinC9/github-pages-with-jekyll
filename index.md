# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about interesting events both past and present in my life. To begin I live in Versailles, Kentucky. I love the bluegrass state, I mean who wouldn't? We have horses, bourbon, and great food; what else could you want? So stay tuned into my blog for some interesting material.
